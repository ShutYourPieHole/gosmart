# gosmart
A Go (golang) library to interface with the Samsung SmartThings (IoT) API.

This is a Go Library to allow easy interfacing between a Go program and the SmartThings API.
The library is under heavy development, but can already perform an OAuth login to SmartThings,
save and restore the token locally, and fetch device names and sensor values.

Check back soon (and often) for new developments.
